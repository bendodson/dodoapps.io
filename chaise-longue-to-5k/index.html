			<p>Use other apps like video players whilst doing a run with Chaise Longue to 5K, a "Couch to 5K" app that will help you build up your fitness level and stamina over a period of 9 weeks. Each week you'll do 3 runs with a day of rest inbetween. Each day is a combination of running and walking; you'll start with just 8 minutes of running interspersed with walking but eventually build up to 30 minutes of uninterrupted running (which is equivalent to a distance of 5km).</p>

			<p>Chaise Longue to 5K is available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chaise-longue-to-5k/id1633434180">for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac on the App Store</a> and contains no advertising, no tracking, and no in-app purchases.</p>
