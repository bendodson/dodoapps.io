			<p>Music Tracker is an iPhone app that keeps an eye on your music library and monitors additions, deletions, and any changes to your songs. With streaming becoming more popular, it is very easy for song metadata to change or for songs to disappear as licensing deals expire; with Music Tracker, you will always know when something in your library changes whether it was by you, a family member, or your streaming service.</p>

			<h3>Automatic Monitoring</h3>
			<p>With automatic checking of your library, you can have peace of mind that if anything in your library changes, you'll know about it. Everything is stored locally so you can see a full history of your library changes from the date you install the app onwards. Every change is visible on a granular level so you can see exactly what was altered be it title, artist, album, genre, or rating.</p>

			<h3>Apple Watch App</h3>
			<p>Included with Music Tracker is a full Apple Watch app that allows you to see how many songs are in your library, and how many songs have been added, changed, or deleted today (along with name and artist of those tracks). In addition, there is a glance providing this information in a single screen and text-based complications for the Utility, Modular, and Mickey Mouse faces with a quick summary of your library today.</p>

			<h3>Summary Notification</h3>
			<p>You can enable an optional summary notification in the app settings - this will send you a push notification in the morning if any changes were detected in your library on the previous day.</p>

			<h3>Fully Native App</h3>
			<p>Music Tracker is built solely for iPhone and is fully native. This makes it incredibly fast and fluid whilst enabling advanced features such as 3D Touch support on the iPhone 6s / 6s Plus along with "peek and pop" gestures. The app is fully optimised for all iPhone screen sizes and runs on iOS 9.0 and above. Due to the intensiveness of processing (especially with a large music library), Music Tracker requires an iPhone with a 64-bit processor so will only run on the iPhone 5s and later models.</p>

			<h3>Privacy</h3>
			<p>Music Tracker contains no in-app purchases and does not require an internet connection; we believe in your privacy so none of your library data ever leaves your device. We've also made Apple aware (via bug report <a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6078139771912192">rdar://24168798</a>) that currently developers do not need any permission to access the music library and they definitely should. You can find out more in our <a href="/music-tracker/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

			<h3>Download</h3>
			<p>Music Tracker will be available on the App Store on Wednesday 20th January 2016 and is priced at $0.99 / Â£0.79.</p>
