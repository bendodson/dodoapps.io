			<p>If you run into any issues with Music Tracker, please contact us via email at:</p>
			<a href="mailto:support@dodoapps.io" id="contact-email">support@dodoapps.io</a>
			<p>We aim to get back to all emails within 48 hours. Please note that we can't reply to comments left on the App Store so email is always preferable for bug reports and constructive criticism.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in having an app developed, please view the website of developer <a href="https://bendodson.com/" title="freelance iPhone developer">Ben Dodson</a> for details.</p>

			<h3>Answers to common issues</h3>
			
			<h4>Music Tracker is not updating in the background.</h4>
			<p>Please ensure you have push notifications enabled in your settings. Whilst Music Tracker can use Background App Refresh, this typically only works if you are opening the app on a regular basis. We always recommend enabling push notifications as it allows us to reliably wake up the app and trigger a scan of your library in the background.</p>

			<h4>Music Tracker isn't showing any changes.</h4>
			<p>First of all, please ensure you have push notifications enabled in order to activate automatic tracking. If that isn't working, please try a manual refresh by either pulling down on the opening screen (if using v1.2 or lower) or by tapping the refresh icon (in v1.3 and above). If that isn't working, please <a href="mailto:support@dodoapps.io">contact us</a> ensuring you let us know what device you are using and how many songs are in your library. Please be aware that v1.3 fixes issues with older devices and larger libraries not updating correctly so ensure you have the latest version of Music Tracker installed from the App Store.</p>

			<h4>Does Music Tracker keep track of my playlists?</h4>
			<p>Not yet but we're looking into it.</p>

			<h4>Why can't Music Tracker give me changes prior to when I installed the app?</h4>
			<p>Music Tracker works by looking at your library and keeping a local copy of all the metadata. We then check periodically for any changes and alert you to them. Unfortunately the media library on the iPhone does not store a historical log nor does it store data about when the track was first added to your library so we can only show changes from the date you installed Music Tracker onwards.</p>

			<h4>Does Music Tracker work with Spotify?</h4>
			<p>No, Music Tracker only works with songs in the media library on your iPhone or iPad (whether they were imported manually or synced via iTunes Match, Apple Music, or iCloud Music Library).</p>

			<h4>When will Music Tracker be avaiable for Android?</h4>
			<p>It won't. We only build iOS apps.</p>
