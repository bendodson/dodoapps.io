			<p>We respect your privacy. For that reason, Music Tracker doesn't use your data or try and gain information about you via analytics. By default, nothing ever leaves your device. If you enable push notifications, we will be given a unique identifier from Apple (unlinkable to you) that will allow us to send you push notifications. No information about your device, music library, or any personal information is ever sent back to us and all processing of your library is done on your device.</p>
			<p>With regards to push notifications, we use these in order to keep your music library tracking up to date by making use of "silent push notifications". This technology allows us to wake up your app periodically and scan your library for changes but we will never send you a text or sound based notification unless you enable the morning summary notification (in which case 
			push notifications are used solely for that purpose and won't be used for marketing, spamming, or any other nonsense).</p>
			<p>Music Tracker contains no advertising, tracking, analytics, or in-app purchases.</p>
